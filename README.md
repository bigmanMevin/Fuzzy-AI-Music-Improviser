# Fuzzy-AI-Music-Improviser
A creative music improvisation tool that blends AI and fuzzy logic to apply expressive audio effects like pitch, tempo, and reverb based on user input or music style descriptions. Built with Python and Tkinter.
# ðŸŽ¶ Music Improvisation and Effects Tool

This project is a Python-based desktop application that lets you load an audio file and apply creative effects like pitch shift, reverb, distortion, and tempo changes. You can control everything manually using sliders or let the built-in AI suggest settings based on how you describe the music (e.g., "happy pop" or "sad jazz").

The idea is to make music editing more intuitive and expressive, especially for people who prefer creativity over technical controls.

## âœ¨ What It Can Do

- Load and play audio files (like `.wav`, `.mp3`, or `.flac`)
- Show waveform and spectrogram visualizations of the audio
- Manually adjust pitch, reverb, distortion, and tempo
- Use AI to understand your music style and auto-apply effects
- Save the modified audio file
- Reset everything with one click if you want to start over
